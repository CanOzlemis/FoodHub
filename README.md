Food Hub is a food ordering service that is going to allow for a fair competitive
environment to all restaurants while benefiting the customers for easier ordering procedures.
With this application, it is going to be much easier to find new restaurants and experience new
tastes and dishes. Meanwhile restaurants will get the chance to have more customers without
having to pay a lot of money for the promotion of their restaurant and dishes. This project aims
to increase the quality of life to whomever that uses it while having a minimal time getting used
to using the application.
